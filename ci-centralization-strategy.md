## Context

### Trigger

CI/CD configuration is duplicated across ~280 repositories in the three target
orgs (`swift-primitives`, `swift-standards`, `swift-foundations`). Phase 0 of
the centralization effort (recorded in `HANDOFF-ci-centralization.md`) polished
`swift-property-primitives` into a reference case study using reusable
workflows (`uses: swift-institute/.github/.github/workflows/…@main`). Before
rolling out to 280+ repos, Phase 1 is to evaluate alternative centralization
strategies and record a durable recommendation so Phase 2+ doesn't churn.

### Scope

Ecosystem-wide [RES-002a]. Affects every public and private repo across the
three target orgs. Out of scope: `coenttb/*`, external-compat packages
(`swift-testing`, `swift-tracing`, `swift-http-routing`), rule-law ecosystem,
`swift-institute` sub-repos.

### Empirical state (2026-04-21)

Verified from source for this document:

- `swift-institute` org plan: **Free**
  (`gh api orgs/swift-institute --jq .plan.name` → `"free"`).
- GitHub's "required workflows" feature is **deprecated as of January 2024**
  and replaced by repository rulesets
  (`gh api repos/swift-institute/.github/actions/required_workflows` returns
  HTTP 422 with: *"this feature is fully deprecated and creating required
  workflows is only available with repository rulesets. All existing workflows
  have been automatically migrated to rulesets."*).
- Repository rulesets and organization rulesets are restricted to GitHub
  Team / Enterprise plans per GitHub docs
  ([About rulesets](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets)).
- Local rename cascade has not propagated to GitHub remotes: `gh api
  repos/swift-primitives/swift-rendering-primitives` → 200; `.../swift-render-primitives`
  → 404.

## Question

Which centralization strategy should the three Swift Institute orgs adopt
for CI/CD across ~280 repos?

Sub-questions:

- Is the reusable-workflow pattern (Phase 0) the right long-term foundation,
  or an interim that should yield to a different approach?
- What CI-adjacent configuration can also centralize, and by which mechanism?
- What is the right ref strategy for caller workflows (`@main` vs. tag)?

## Analysis

### Option A — Reusable workflows (`workflow_call`)

**Description**: Caller repos include a thin `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
whose jobs use `uses: swift-institute/.github/.github/workflows/<name>.yml@<ref>`.
All build/test/lint logic lives in the central `swift-institute/.github` repo
and is consumed at run time. Current Phase 0 pattern.

Inputs and secrets flow through explicit `with:` and `secrets:` blocks. The
reusable workflow can declare `permissions:`, `timeout-minutes:`, and complex
multi-job matrices; the caller owns only triggers, concurrency, and overrides.

**Advantages**:

- Zero GitHub plan cost — a free-plan public `.github` repo serves every
  consumer.
- Validated: Phase 0 empirically tested on `property-primitives`
  (swift-format bundled in Swift 6.3 toolchain; prebuilt SwiftLint binary;
  full DocC pipeline), all exit codes and config-loading paths verified.
- Flexible per-repo customization via inputs — the reference case study shows
  `umbrella-module`, `exclude-modules`, `paths`, `swiftlint-version` as
  override points.
- Standard GitHub Actions mechanism since October 2021, documented at
  [Reusing workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows).

**Disadvantages**:

- Opt-in: each caller must declare the `uses:` reference. A repo with no
  caller gets no CI.
- Shared fate on the ref: `@main` means a compromise or regression in
  `swift-institute/.github@main` breaks every consumer simultaneously. Tag
  pinning mitigates this at a release-discipline cost.
- Caller file stays in every repo (cannot be removed without losing CI).

**Constraints**: GitHub Actions ecosystem only. Reusable workflows can call
other reusables (up to 4 levels deep per GitHub docs), but cannot be used
from GitLab / Bitbucket / Jenkins.

---

### Option B — Repository / organization rulesets

**Description**: GitHub's replacement for the deprecated "required workflows"
feature. A ruleset at the repo or org level can declare that certain checks
must pass before merge. Combined with a workflow file (inline or reusable),
the ruleset enforces that CI ran and passed. Rulesets can be scoped to
specific branches (e.g., `main`) and bypassed by named actors.

**Advantages**:

- **Enforcement** rather than convention — repos cannot merge bypassing CI
  without an explicit bypass path.
- Org-level rulesets apply to every repo in the org, including newly created
  ones, without per-repo setup.
- Co-exists with reusable workflows: the ruleset points at the same
  workflow file; rulesets enforce *that it ran*, reusables define *what it
  does*. They are complementary, not alternative.

**Disadvantages**:

- **Not available on GitHub Free** per GitHub's
  [ruleset docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets):
  repository rulesets require Team or Enterprise; organization rulesets
  require Enterprise. The swift-institute org is Free today.
- Requires ongoing plan spend — a commitment this research doesn't justify
  on its own.
- Does not replace workflow files; it only enforces they run. The workflow
  files themselves still need to exist in each repo (inline or as reusable
  callers). Rulesets are additive to Option A, not alternative to it.

**Constraints**: Plan gate. Rulesets configured at org level need
`admin:org` scope for API access
(`gh api orgs/swift-institute/rulesets` → 404 in this investigation due to
scope, not because rulesets don't exist — but the plan gate is independent).

---

### Option C — Git subtree / submodule of `.github/`

**Description**: Each consumer repo pulls a shared `.github/` directory as a
git subtree or submodule, vendoring the workflow files in-repo and synced via
`git subtree pull` or `git submodule update`.

**Advantages**:

- Each repo carries its own pinned copy at a specific commit.
- Works with any CI provider (no GitHub Actions lock-in).

**Disadvantages**:

- Poor developer experience: every clone / fresh checkout needs submodule
  init; subtree `pull` is error-prone with squashed histories; merge
  conflicts on the subtree path are tedious.
- No advantage over the sync-script model (Option D) for workflow
  distribution — both push files into each repo. Subtree adds a git-level
  machinery layer for no win.
- Prior research (`git-subtree-publication-pattern.md`, 2026-02-26, Tier 2
  DECISION) rejected subtree for package publication on similar grounds.
  The team's existing stance weighs against reintroducing it here.

**Constraints**: Requires contributors to have subtree / submodule familiarity
or tolerate the friction.

---

### Option D — Sync-script model

**Description**: Canonical template in `swift-institute/Scripts/` plus a
sync script that overwrites the target file in every sub-repo. Pattern
already established by:

- `sync-gitignore.sh` (2026-03-12 `gitignore-sync-strategy.md` DECISION)
- `sync-community-health.sh` (org-level community health files)
- `sync-dependabot.sh` (Phase 0b this session)
- `sync-skills.sh` (skills symlinks)
- `sync-swift-settings.sh` (Package.swift SwiftSettings)

**Advantages**:

- No runtime dependency on a central repo — once synced, each consumer runs
  independently. Survives `swift-institute/.github` outages.
- Works for any file: workflow YAML, config files, scripts. Already a
  team idiom with four sibling scripts.
- Explicit commit trail per sync. Easy to audit what changed when.

**Disadvantages**:

- Drift between syncs: a repo's local file can diverge until the next sync
  run. Not a problem for infrequently-changing configs; would be a problem
  for rapidly-iterated CI logic.
- Not reactive: changes to the canonical template propagate only when
  someone runs the sync script.
- Commit burst: a single template change produces N commits across N repos,
  which is noisy in dashboards and tool analytics.

**Constraints**: The maintainer (or CI job) must run the sync. If the
maintainer forgets, repos drift silently.

### Comparison

| Criterion                      | A: Reusable | B: Rulesets | C: Subtree | D: Sync-script |
|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| Plan cost (2026-04-21)         | Free        | Team+       | Free       | Free           |
| Enforcement                    | No (opt-in) | Yes         | No        | No             |
| New-repo auto-coverage         | No          | Yes (org)   | No        | Yes on sync    |
| Latency of central change      | 0 s (next run) | 0 s      | Manual    | Manual         |
| Offline from central repo      | Breaks      | Breaks      | Works     | Works          |
| Blast radius of central compromise | High   | High        | Low       | Low            |
| DX for contributors            | Easy        | Easy        | Poor      | Easy           |
| Suits rapidly-iterating logic  | Yes         | Yes         | No        | No             |
| Suits per-repo static config   | No          | N/A         | Yes       | Yes            |
| Already in use in ecosystem    | Yes (Phase 0) | No        | No        | Yes (4 scripts) |

**Interpretation**: Options A and D are complementary along the "rapidly
iterating logic" vs. "per-repo static config" axis. Option B requires a plan
upgrade and is additive to A, not alternative. Option C offers no advantage
over D for workflow distribution.

### What else can centralize?

Phase 1's second question: which CI-adjacent configurations should move,
and under which mechanism?

| Artifact                        | Mechanism     | Status |
|---------------------------------|---------------|--------|
| Build/test/docs/format/lint workflows | A (reusable) | In place Phase 0 |
| `dependabot.yml`                | D (sync script) | Template + script delivered Phase 0b; sync deferred |
| `.gitignore`                    | D (sync script) | In place since 2026-03-12 (`sync-gitignore.sh`) |
| `.swift-format`, `.swiftlint.yml` | D (sync script) | In place via `sync-swift-settings.sh` and/or `sync-gitignore.sh` — verify coverage |
| Org-level community health (CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING, GOVERNANCE, etc.) | GitHub inheritance from `swift-institute/.github` | In place; `GOVERNANCE.md` added Phase 0b |
| `swift-tools-version` in Package.swift | D (sync script) candidate | Not yet automated; candidate for Phase 1 extension |
| `Package.swift` `platforms:` blocks | D (sync script) candidate | Not yet automated; candidate if drift becomes a problem |
| DocC build paths / umbrella names | A (workflow input — already `umbrella-module:` etc.) | In place via `swift-docs.yml` inputs |
| Release workflows (tag → GitHub Release) | A (reusable, future) | Not yet designed; Phase 1+ |

`swift-tools-version` is the most promising next candidate for sync — a
single line in every Package.swift that should move in lockstep across the
ecosystem when the toolchain floor bumps. `Package.swift platforms:` blocks
drift freely today; whether that's a problem is a Phase-2 observation.

## Prior art survey [RES-021]

- **Apple's own ecosystem**: `apple/swift-foundation`, `apple/swift-collections`,
  `apple/swift-syntax` use per-repo inline workflows, not reusable workflows.
  Each repo is large enough to justify its own CI config. Not directly
  applicable to a 280-repo ecosystem.
- **Large monorepos moving to reusables**:
  [microsoft/vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode),
  [angular/angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) use `.github/`
  directories with org-level reusables + repo-level triggers — similar to
  Option A in shape. They operate at 10k+ star scale with paid plans, so
  they also layer rulesets on top (Option A + Option B hybrid).
- **The `.github` repo pattern** is documented by GitHub as
  [org community health defaults](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).
  The extension to hosting reusable workflows there is a community idiom, not
  a formally-documented pattern, but is widely used (e.g.,
  [pointfreeco/.github](https://github.com/pointfreeco) for the
  `pointfreeco` org's shared workflows).
- **Contextualization step per [RES-021]**: "required workflows" (now
  rulesets) is universally adopted in enterprise CI systems (Jenkins shared
  libraries, GitLab CI `include:`, CircleCI orbs). In a Free-plan GitHub
  setting, Option A + Option D is the closest analogue that does not require
  plan escalation. The absence of enforcement is a real trade-off — repos
  can silently skip CI — but the cost of escalating plans for 280 repos is
  non-trivial, and the lint/format gates already enforce themselves at PR
  review time.

## Recommendation

**Status**: RECOMMENDATION.

### Primary strategy

**Adopt Option A (reusable workflows) as the foundational pattern** for
cross-cutting CI logic: build/test matrix, DocC, format, lint. Phase 0
validated this empirically on `property-primitives`; the reusables handle
version drift (swift-format bundled in Swift 6+), install optimization
(prebuilt SwiftLint binary), and full DocC aggregation. The design is in
production shape.

### Secondary strategy

**Adopt Option D (sync-script model) for operational per-repo configs**
that reusable workflows cannot address: `dependabot.yml`,
`.swift-format`, `.swiftlint.yml`, `.gitignore`, and future candidates like
`swift-tools-version`. The ecosystem already uses this pattern for four
other artifacts; Phase 0b added the fifth (`sync-dependabot.sh`). Continue
extending.

### Reject

- **Option B (rulesets)**: unavailable on the current Free plan and
  strictly additive to A rather than alternative. Revisit if/when the org
  upgrades to Team plan for some other reason.
- **Option C (subtree/submodule)**: no advantage over D for workflow
  distribution; poor DX; prior research already rejected subtree in a
  parallel decision.

### Ref strategy for callers

Phase 0 uses `@main`. Recommend moving to **`@v1` tag pinning** once Phase 0
lands to origin:

- Tag `swift-institute/.github@v1.0.0` after Phase 0 merges.
- Update `property-primitives` callers to `@v1`.
- Treat `@v1` as a rolling tag — bump it to the tip of main on reusable
  changes that are non-breaking.
- Bump to `@v2` for breaking changes in the reusable-workflow input surface.

This matches common reusable-workflow practice in the Actions ecosystem
(e.g., `actions/checkout@v6` — the user pins a major tag that tracks
compatible patches). It narrows the blast radius of a `@main` compromise
(Phase 0's one remaining open concern) without requiring per-SHA pin
discipline.

### Optional future layer

If the org later upgrades to Team plan for private-repo rulesets or other
reasons, add **Option B (rulesets) on top of Option A** to enforce that CI
runs on every PR. This is additive, not replacing. No need to wait for it
to start Phase 2.

---

## Implementation path

Phase-by-phase sequencing for acting on this recommendation:

1. **Phase 0 + 0b commit + push** (user action, unchanged from HANDOFF):
   push `swift-institute/.github` (central first) then `swift-property-primitives`.
2. **Tag `swift-institute/.github@v1.0.0`** once pushed. Update
   `property-primitives` callers from `@main` to `@v1`. Verify CI green.
3. **Run `sync-dependabot.sh`** across 280 repos (template + script already
   delivered Phase 0b; 282 of 283 would update per dry-run). Review the
   first handful of PRs it generates on unchanged repos to confirm
   expected behavior.
4. **Community-health file inheritance audit**: sweep the three orgs for
   local copies of `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
   `FUNDING.yml`, `GOVERNANCE.md`. Delete redundant local copies so they
   inherit from `swift-institute/.github`.
5. **GitHub remote-name reconciliation**: the 60-commit local rename cascade
   (`swift-rendering-primitives` → `swift-render-primitives` etc.) has not
   propagated to GitHub. Phase-2 rollout scripts must either rename via `gh
   api` first or key on the remote names. Sample-verified: old names
   still resolve; new names do not.
6. **Phase 2 (pilot)**: apply the reference-case pattern to one additional
   primitive (e.g., `swift-buffer-primitives`, `swift-render-primitives`
   after its GitHub rename). Verify CI green before batching.
7. **Phase 3 (rollout)**: script migration across remaining ~280 repos. Use
   the Phase 2 pilot as the template commit.
8. **Ongoing**: periodic `--dry-run` on each sync script to surface drift.
   Consider a weekly scheduled workflow in `swift-institute/.github` that
   runs all sync dry-runs and opens issues on drift.
