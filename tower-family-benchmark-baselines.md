## Context

Arc 3 of the post-W5 tower iteration (`GOAL-tower-arc-bench.md`; weakness-sweep §2bis #3):
iteration will change internals (the Generational SoA re-cut and the Tree.Position re-cut — arc 5
is explicitly BENCH-GATED on this arc), so the family-tier benchmark surface and RECORDED baselines
must exist BEFORE optimizing. Before this arc, only R4's alias-dispatch cost was measured
(`column-spelling-ergonomics-alias-vocabulary.md`: gate ≈ 4.3 ns/op worst-case, 0 on move-only
columns); everything else was asserted-but-unmeasured (the P lens). **This document records
measurements only — no optimization edits ride this arc; observed anomalies are banked in §Banked
candidates for arc-5's gate.**

Prior art ([RES-019] grep, 2026-06-11): `benchmarking-strategy.md` (the `.timed()` infrastructure
inventory), `benchmark-inline-strategy.md` (parameter-ownership split), `benchmark-result-storage.md`
(DECISION: machine-dependent timing data is never committed — `.benchmarks/` gitignored; this doc
records CURATED baselines with full methodology, the swift-collections announcement-benchmark
class, not result-file dumps), `swift-testing-performance-infrastructure-gaps.md` (cross-suite
serialization + attribution lessons). None is a baselines record; this document is new surface.

## Method

### Instrument

Per-family **nested benchmark packages** (`Benchmarks/Package.swift` beside `Tests/`, the io-bench
shape; [BENCH-001] primitives row) containing **executable targets** run via

```
rm -rf .build                                   # [BENCH-002]; the io-bench 82GB precedent
TOOLCHAINS=org.swift.632202605101a swift build -c release
TOOLCHAINS=org.swift.632202605101a swift run -c release --skip-build "<Family> Benchmarks"
```

— release-only by invocation, never `swift test` (arc GOAL discipline; the io-bench
process-hang precedent, `swift-io/Research/io-bench-process-hang.md`).

**Methodology deviation, flagged for the seat's W1 ruling** ([BENCH-003] mandates the `.timed()`
trait): the institute `.timed()` stack lives in swift-tests/swift-testing (L3 foundations), which
does not build against the reshaped tower on 6.3.2 — the W5 friction log records the L2/standards
tier blocking ALL foundations legs (pre-W1 `Memory.Allocation` spellings; scope ruling F-3 pending),
and the workspace scope is L1-only. The toolchain's own `Testing` module reaches the tower test
targets but has no `.timed()`. The instrument therefore generalizes the **R4 microprobe shape**
(the named methodology precedent): release executable, `ContinuousClock` batch timing, opaque
`@inline(never)` sinks/sources against constant folding and hoisting, fixed checked-in workloads.
`.timed()` adoption is re-openable the moment foundations re-reach the tower.

### Harness shape (proven on the array family, W1)

- **Batching**: each timed sample executes one batch of `opsPerBatch` operations; per-op ns =
  batch duration / opsPerBatch. Batch targets are sized so every sample is ≥ ~0.5 ms (clock
  granularity ≪ 0.1 % of sample): per-element shapes ~2M element-ops, build shapes ~262k slots,
  whole-copy shapes ≥ 16 copies (~4M copied slots).
- **Samples**: 2 untimed warmup batches, then 9 timed samples per case; the FULL per-sample
  vector is emitted (`BENCH {...}` JSON lines), never just a point estimate.
- **Statistics**: median, min, max, CV% across the 9 samples; cross-run agreement is checked over
  3 independent process invocations of the same binary (variance reported alongside every median;
  the seat re-runs samples and checks within stated variance, never exact-number match).
- **Optimizer discipline**: every measured loop's input passes through `@inline(never)` opaque
  sources and its output through an `@inline(never)` accumulating sink printed at exit; state
  lives in real heap-backed structures, and move-only state stays in stack frames captured by
  non-escaping batch closures.
- **Subjects**: `tower.direct` (`Array<HeapColumn<E>>`-class move-only columns), `tower.cow`
  (`Array<Shared<E, HeapColumn<E>>>`-class CoW columns), `stdlib` (the matching Swift standard
  library structure) — identical workloads, identical batch shapes ([BENCH-005]).
- **Setup isolation**: persistent subject structures and index streams are built OUTSIDE timed
  regions; build-shape cases include teardown inside the batch on every subject alike (stated
  per shape).
- **Honest bounding** ([BENCH-011], the R4 interpretation discipline): micro numbers bound the
  primitive, they do not predict workloads. Any number that would drive an architecture decision
  through a Copyable wrapper requires the dual-mode (isolated + integrated) probe before promotion.

### Environment (W1 record)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Machine | MacBook Air 15″ (`Mac15,13`), Apple M3, 4P+4E cores, 24 GiB, **fanless** |
| Toolchain | `Apple Swift version 6.3.2 (swift-6.3.2-RELEASE), Target: arm64-apple-macosx26.0`, `TOOLCHAINS=org.swift.632202605101a` |
| OS | macOS 26.2 (25C56) |
| Config | `-c release`, `swiftLanguageModes: [.v6]`, strict memory safety + ecosystem feature flags (family manifests' exact block); build of record clean, zero warnings by full grep |
| Run conditions (W1) | Interactive dev machine with parallel executor arcs active. Stable background during the recorded runs: ONE sibling single-threaded `swift-frontend` at 100% of one core (arc-2's hash-table test build; bracketing `ps` checks + load averages recorded per run). Run-set acceptance is BY CROSS-RUN AGREEMENT: runs 1–3 primary (≤~7% pairwise on nearly all cases), run 4 (~25 min later) corroborates within ±10%; runs 5–6 caught a multi-process load burst (5-min load 7.5), inflated 25–55% uniformly across ALL subjects, and are EXCLUDED by that criterion (preserved in the W1 log sidecar). |

| Run conditions (W2 batch-1) | Recorded 23:11–23:22 after a 60s-clear sustained-quiet gate; EVERY per-run bracket read procs=0 (the only fully-clean session of the arc). Caveat: the window followed a 33-process build storm on the fanless machine — thermal drain is visible as a quality gradient across the session (set-ordered first/hottest: 55/60 cases >10% cross-run spread; dictionary-ordered last/coolest: 11/60). The array drift-canary in this window read median Δ 10.8% vs W1 (p90 19%) — ABOVE W1's stated spreads; the cooler 22:40 opportunistic canary read 3.0%, so the excess is attributed to thermal state, not drift. Within-session family comparisons are unaffected; cross-referencing W2 absolute numbers against W1's carries the ~10% caveat. W3 cool-window re-confirmation (23:27, procs=0, 20 min idle): **median Δ 1.9%, p90 5.6%, 2/74 cases >10%** — thermal attribution CONFIRMED (hot 10.8% → cooler 3.0% → cool 1.9%); no drift. |

| Run conditions (batch-2, W4) | Quiet-gated 06:31–06:40 (06-12); procs=0 at every bracket; canary median Δ 2.0% vs W1. Zero flagged cases in slot-map (33) and arena (18); 2/22 minor in hash-table. The cleanest session of the arc. |

| Run conditions (terminal wave) | Shared leg recorded in the arc's coolest window (procs=0, load 2.4); stack/set/dict session procs=0 at every bracket; canary median Δ 1.8% (the arc's best). |

No cross-machine comparisons: every number in this document is from the machine identified above.

## Baselines

> Unit: ns/op (median of 9 samples, CV% in parentheses), run-to-run agreement over 3 invocations.
> `detach`/`clone` rows: one op = one whole-array copy at the row's n.

### Array (proving family, W1) — swift-array-primitives, bench beside tip `257a617`

Primary = median of run-medians over runs 1–3 (`±` = max pairwise run spread; `cv` = worst
within-run CV across the 9 samples; `r4` = run-4 corroboration delta). Element type `Int`
except the `payload.*` rows (`final class` element). Build shapes (`append.*`, `pushPop`,
`payload.append`) include per-rep teardown inside the batch on every subject alike.

**Validated claims** (the asserted-but-unmeasured class, now measured):

1. **Typed indices are cost-free at the access path**: `get.indexed` tower.direct ≡ stdlib
   (0.288 vs 0.295 @1k; 0.313 vs 0.304 @64k) and `get.span` is three-way identical (0.073–0.075).
2. **The move-only column's writes beat stdlib ~3.8×** (`set.indexed` 0.30 vs 1.14): no
   uniqueness machinery on the direct column vs stdlib's per-write `_makeMutableAndUnique`.
3. **Span-first bulk mutation amortizes the CoW gate to ~zero** (`set.span` cow 0.08–0.11 vs
   `set.indexed` cow ~7.9 → ~70–100×; R4's guidance, now with family-grade numbers).
4. **Read paths are gate-free on both columns** as designed (`get.*` cow ≡ direct at n ≥ 1k;
   the box hop is visible only at n=16, +~50% on a 0.3 ns op).
5. **Payload inversion strength datum**: for refcounted elements the `Shared` detach is
   1.66× FASTER than stdlib's (2,864 vs 4,766 ns @1k) — the element-loop retain/release path
   beats stdlib's bridged copy machinery on this shape.

**Read with care**: `set.span` n=1,024 carries ±27–31% run spread on cow/stdlib (sub-0.1 ns/op
shape, 16k span re-entries per pass; DVFS-sensitive) — its qualitative conclusion (≈ gate-free
bulk) is robust, its point estimate is not. `append.*`/`pushPop` rows include array
init+teardown per rep, amortized over n ops (dominant at n=16 — see the n=16 vs n=1k drop).

### Set (flat) — terminal wave, bench beside tip `2bb62d2` (commit `ac7a1a9`)

Recorded 2026-06-12 (terminal session; procs=0 at every bracket; in-window canary vs W1:
median Δ 1.8%, p90 6.2% — the arc's best conditions). The flat family composes the SAME `Hash.Indexed`
combinator as Set.Ordered — B-7 applies here too:

**B-7's blast radius extended as predicted**: flat-family `churn.steady` @64k runs
143 µs (set) / 119 µs (dict) per pair vs stdlib's flat 66–68 ns (**≈2,100×**) — the
Θ(capacity) sweep fires identically without any rank surface. **Flat vs Ordered (the
inventory's "iteration-order overhead vs unordered", answered in-tower at identical
combinator):**

The rank surface costs ≈4% on insert/lookup and **zero on iteration** — order is nearly
free where it is not being removed; B-7 is the entire ordered-family penalty story.
Wipe-row caveat: `buildWipe.keep` builds pre-sized while `insert.zero` builds from zero —
the wipe delta is not directly subtractable (recorded as the consumer-grade build+wipe
cycle; the set-direct rows carry ±23–30% from wipe-phase variance, the FIXED CoW door is
stable).

### Set.Ordered — W2 batch-1, bench beside tip `3e44537` (commit `3f76acf`)

Recorded 2026-06-11 ~23:11–23:22 in a bracketed clean window (procs=0 at EVERY
bracket; post-storm thermal drain noted — set-ordered ran first/hottest and carries the
widest spreads, dictionary-ordered last/coolest and the tightest; magnitudes agree across
both). Primary = median of 3 run-medians; ± = max pairwise run spread; cv = worst within-run
CV. Pins at the build of record are in REPORT-arc-bench-W2 (hash-table at `2eae321` for the
ordered families).

**The order-preserving remove curve (the inventory's target), both families**: one op = one
remove+insert pair at steady occupancy n. Against stdlib's flat ~40–68 ns, the tower pair
cost grows super-linearly to ~141–238 µs at n=64k (≈3,000–5,600×). Two distinct facets:
(1) the documented dense shift is NOT the dominant term — see banked B-7 (the Θ(capacity)
bucket sweep on every remove, `Hash.Table+PositionUpdates.swift:45–57`); (2) an INVERSION at
n ≥ 4k: removing the NEWEST element (zero shift, zero fixups) costs MORE than removing the
oldest (dict @64k: 199 µs back vs 158 µs front, spreads ≤ ~11%) — unexplained by the sweep
alone; banked as B-7's anomaly facet. `iterate.sum` is the counterweight strength: the dense
buffer scans 4–11× FASTER than stdlib's buckets (set 0.07 vs 0.74; dict 0.17 vs 0.73 ns/elem).
Reads through the `Shared` column pay ~+10–16 ns/lookup that array's reads did NOT show —
banked B-8.

**Per-instance seeding quantified**: `init.zero` 273 ns vs `Swift.Set`'s ~0 (free empty
singleton; the institute Table pays `makeSeed()`'s `SystemRandomNumberGenerator` read +
allocation per instance — `Hash.Table.swift:124`). `init.sized` grows O(capacity) with the
bucket-metadata fill (~0.83 ns/bucket at 64k: 54.7 µs) where stdlib's sized init stays
58–854 ns. `init.firstInsert` 504 vs 43 ns (11.8×). Steady inserts: reserved 20–24 vs
stdlib 9.2–10.7 ns (≈2.2×); the growth tax (zero − reserved) ≈ +23–25 ns/insert vs stdlib's
+10–17. Two rows flagged ~15% (init.sized stdlib @64k; build.reserved @1k) — noted, minor.

### Slot-map — batch-2, bench beside tip `a420d48` (commit `23e6cd5`)

Recorded 2026-06-12 06:31–06:40, quiet-gated (60 s sustained-clear), procs=0 at EVERY
bracket; in-window array canary vs W1: median Δ 2.0% (p90 6.7%) — recording-grade
conditions throughout. Pins: the batch-2 tips themselves (arena `52537ef` · slot-map
`a420d48` · hash-table `7b3052a`, seat-granted post-W3-0).

**Zero cases flagged** (all spreads ≤ ~9%). Handle-validated access is **1.21 ns flat
across three decades** of slot count — vs 0.30 ns raw `[Int]` (the ledger+wrapper tax
≈ 0.9 ns/access) and vs 6.0–11.9 ns `Swift.Dictionary` (the stable-key alternative loses
5–10× AND degrades with n while the slot-map stays flat). Stale-handle rejection costs the
same as a hit (0.81 ns — the generation compare is the whole check). The CoW box adds
+2.5 ns/read here (single hop) — sharpening B-8: the ordered families' +10–16 ns is
per-PROBE re-entry, not the hop itself.

**The B-1′ re-attribution (the engine-fix arc's target map):** the uniqueness gate ALONE
costs **1.06 ns** — three-way agreement (isolated prepareForMutation; ensureUnique; the
gated−assumingUnique pair difference 6.21−5.15). The dominant term is the **box ≈3.9 ns**
(assumingUnique 5.15 vs bare column 1.19); family seams add ≈2–3 ns more to the ~7 ns
family-level tax. Reads through the box are free on the subscript path (0.17 vs 0.16);
bulk spans amortize everything (0.07). Detach: 1,322 ns @1k / 76.4 µs @64k (**1.17–1.29
ns/slot** — B-2's element-wise copy confirmed at box level). R4's ~4.3 ns synthetic bound
was the gate + an @inline(never) work boundary; the shipped inlinable gate on a
predicted-true branch runs ~1 ns.

### Queue — W2 batch-1, bench beside tip `131a0be` (commit `86fd9e4`)

Recorded 2026-06-11 ~23:11–23:22 in a bracketed clean window (procs=0 at EVERY
bracket; post-storm thermal drain noted — set-ordered ran first/hottest and carries the
widest spreads, dictionary-ordered last/coolest and the tightest; magnitudes agree across
both). Primary = median of 3 run-medians; ± = max pairwise run spread; cv = worst within-run
CV.

The ring holds FLAT ~2.6 ns/op (bounded 2.9) across three decades of occupancy while
stdlib-as-queue's O(n) `removeFirst` curve runs 2.1 → 45.3 → 4,345 ns (ring wins ≥17× from
n=1k). The `Shared` column's ~7 ns mutation tax reappears unchanged (cycle cow ≈ 9.4–10.0 vs
direct 2.6) — the third family confirming B-1's cross-family invariance.

### Deque — W2 batch-1, bench beside tip `2ed1691` (commit `f7d4c46`)

Both-ends parity with stdlib where stdlib is O(1) (`backBack` 1.5 vs 1.4–1.9 ns, sub-2 ns
rows carry B-5-class spreads), and the designed blowout where it is not: `frontFront` direct
4.1 ns flat vs stdlib 100 ns @1k / ~9.1 µs @64k; `rotate` 2.6–2.8 ns flat vs 50 ns / 4.8 µs.
The cow tax shows as ~+7–11 ns; deque's gate fires per push AND per pop.

### Stack — terminal wave, bench beside tip `f648181` (commit `f024ded`)

pushPop holds **7.7 ns flat** across three decades vs stdlib's 1.95 (the ~6 ns
hand-rolled-CoW gate+box per op — the same structure B-1′ decomposes). Its detach runs
**2.18–2.31 ns/slot** — 1.8× the `Shared` combinator's 1.17–1.29 on identical payloads:
the hand-rolled copy is measurably worse than the column combinator it predates (a
respell datum). stdlib's sub-2 ns rows at n ≤ 1k carry the B-5 spread class.

**11.4–12.5 ns per relocated slot, linear and stable** across 256 → 64k — the W5
`grow(to:)` door's cost curve, previously unmeasured. Substrate validation (`contains`)
is 0.81 ns flat; the slot-map wrapper adds 0.4 ns. `iterate.holes` (50% occupancy) costs
1.33 vs 0.80 ns full — **the `_occupied` hole-skip ≈ +0.53 ns per visited slot** (≈2× per
LIVE element at half-holes): the SoA re-cut's iterate-side number.

## Banked candidates (arc-5 gate inputs; MEASURE-ONLY discipline)

| # | Observation | Family / site | Why banked (not chased) |
|---|---|---|---|
| B-1 | **`Shared` per-mutation tax ≈ 7.3–7.6 ns/op, ~1.7× the R4 synthetic bound (4.3 ns) and ~7× stdlib's own per-write check (1.1 ns)** — flat across n (set.indexed cow 7.85–8.39 vs direct 0.30; append.reserved cow 8.05 vs direct 0.79). The real path = gate + box hop + cross-module `_modify` chain, not the bare `isKnownUniquelyReferenced` R4 isolated. | shared / `Shared` mutation path; consumer side `Array ~Copyable.swift:94` `_modify` → `store.prepareForMutation()` | Optimization is out of this arc's scope; candidates: inlining audit of the gate chain, hoisting the box-pointer load. Quantify through set/dict/queue rows in W2 first — if ~7 ns is invariant across families it is one shared fix, not seven. |
| B-2 | **`Shared` detach copies element-wise (~1.24 ns/slot); the direct column's `clone()` is memcpy-class (~0.16 ns/slot); stdlib detach ~0.11 ns/slot** — detach @64k = 81.4 µs vs direct clone 10.6 µs (7.7×) vs stdlib 7.4 µs (11×), identical `Int` payload. The detach path lacks a trivial-element bulk-copy fast path. | shared / detach (`prepareForMutation` slow path) vs buffer-linear `clone()` | The single largest measured asymmetry; an arc-5-class change inside `Shared`. [BENCH-011]: any fix proposal needs the dual-mode probe (isolated + a consumer walking detach-heavy workloads). |
| B-3 | **Direct-column growth ops trail stdlib at small/mid scales**: append.reserved 1.8× @1k (0.79 vs 0.44), append.zero 2.7× @1k, pop ≈ 4× (derived 1.42 vs 0.35 @1k) — but CROSSOVER at 64k where direct append.reserved beats stdlib 0.77× (0.61 vs 0.79). | array / seam append–removeLast path (`Array+Columns.swift:36`, `Array ~Copyable.swift:146`) | Family-round material, not arc-5; per-op accounting through the seam (count/capacity Tagged arithmetic, no `reserveCapacity` exponential-hint divergence chased). The 64k win suggests the gap is fixed-overhead, not algorithmic. |
| B-4 | **Tiny-array build cost**: append.zero @16 ≈ 24.7 ns/op tower vs 8.6 stdlib — first-allocation policy difference dominates (stdlib's empty singleton + first-growth heuristics vs the column's immediate allocate). | array+buffer-linear / zero-capacity init + first growth | Ergonomics/policy datum for the family round; n=16 rows are init+teardown-dominated by design (documented). |
| B-5 | **Harness lesson — sub-0.1 ns/op bulk shapes need ≥16M-op batches AND still carry 25–30% spread at mid-n** (`set.span` @1k); at 64k the larger target stabilized them to ≤7.5%. | bench harness (`spanOpsTarget`) | W2 families should put bulk-span rows at large n or report them qualitative-only at mid n. |
| B-6 | (strength, not defect) **Payload detach inversion**: `Shared` detach 1.66× faster than stdlib for class elements @1k. | shared / detach retain loop | Record only — corroborates that B-2 is about the trivial-element fast path specifically, not copy machinery generally. |
| B-7 | **Every `Hash.Indexed` remove is Θ(bucketCapacity)**: `decrement(after:)` sweeps the ENTIRE bucket table unconditionally (`Hash.Table+PositionUpdates.swift:45–57`, called from `Hash.Indexed+Engine.swift:110`) — the documented O(n−rank) dense shift is the cheaper half. Quantified (hash-table pin `2eae321`): evict pairs at n=64k cost 141–238 µs vs stdlib's flat 42–68 ns (≈3,000–5,600×); the curve is super-linear through {16, 256, 4k, 64k} in BOTH ordered families. **Anomaly facet**: at n ≥ 4k, back-eviction (zero shift, zero fixups, read-only sweep) costs MORE than front-eviction (dict @64k: 199 µs vs 158 µs, spreads ≤ ~11%) — inverted vs any sweep-only model; unexplained. | hash-table / `Hash.Table+PositionUpdates.swift:45` + `Hash.Indexed+Engine.swift:110` (both ordered families ride it) | The arc's largest find; an arc-5-class fix inside arc-2's package (last-rank fast path · early-exit · rank→bucket back-pointers · epoch-offset). [BENCH-011] dual-mode gates any fix; the inversion facet needs its own minimal probe first. **PROBE VERDICT (06-12, seat-authorized /tmp probe, read-only)**: the inversion reproduces at the ENGINE level (Hash.Indexed direct, no family wrapper) and is KEY-PATTERN-INDEPENDENT — a bijective key shuffle preserves back/front at 1.15× (64k) and 1.24× (4k) exactly; key-clustering and wrapper effects are ELIMINATED. Remaining suspects are inside the remove path's sweep/insert interaction; the B-7 fix shapes (skip-sweep fast path) would moot the back case regardless. Probe log: `arc-bench-W2-logs/b7-inversion-probe.log`. |
| B-8 | **Ordered-family READS through `Shared` pay ~+10–16 ns/lookup** (dict lookup.hit: cow 24.4–34.8 vs direct 11.2–19.0; set mirrors) — array's read rows showed cow≈direct parity, so the tax is NOT the box hop itself but how `Hash.Indexed`'s probe loop re-enters the box per access instead of borrowing the dense span once. | set-ordered/dict-ordered contains/withValue paths over `Shared<…, Hash.Indexed<…>>` | Family-round candidate (span-first probe loop); cheap relative to B-7 but on every keyed read. |
| B-9 | **Per-instance hash seeding + O(capacity) init fill**: Hash.Table init costs 273 ns (seed syscall) where stdlib's empty Set is free, and sized init pays ~0.83 ns/bucket (54.7 µs at 64k) where stdlib defers. Steady inserts ≈2.2× stdlib. | hash-table / `Hash.Table.swift:124` (`makeSeed`), init's `buffer.fill` | Engine-round candidates: lazy seeding (seed at first insert), lazy/incremental bucket fill. The per-instance seed is a deliberate hardening choice — the COST of the choice is now on record (it buys per-instance probe-sequence diversity). |
| B-10 | **Counted-loop per-rep arena create traps "pool exhausted" under -O** while the IDENTICAL straight-line sequence succeeds (bisect: exact-fill 4 ✓, 256 ✓, fill-200 ✓, then the first in-loop rep traps). Sidestepped in the benches by making the per-rep capacity loop-variant (`n &+ (r & 1)`). | bench-side observation against arena `52537ef`; suspicion class: R-6-adjacent (-O move-only lifecycle mishandling, cf. swiftlang#89832) | NO wall-claim — mechanism unproven; minimal repro is a candidate /issue-investigation (institute Issues only, per standing policy). The bisect evidence + workaround are preserved in the W4 report. |
| B-1′ | (evidence update for B-1) The ~7–9 ns `Shared` per-mutation tax is **cross-family invariant**: array set.indexed Δ≈7.5, queue cycle Δ≈6.8–7.4, deque pairs Δ≈+7–11, ordered insert Δ≈+5–11. One shared fix, not N family fixes. | shared / mutation gate chain | Strengthens B-1's "quantify across families first" disposition — done; the fix is singular. |

1. **Generational SoA re-cut.** Current layout: `_generations: [Int]` and `_occupied:
   [Bool]` are stdlib Arrays inside the tower's own storage tier
   (`Storage.Generational.swift:36–48` — the self-hosting debt, weakness-sweep §2 #5).
   The cost question arc-5 must answer empirically: per validated access, the slot-map
   pays TWO independent stdlib-Array paths (refcount-stable but bounds-checked, separately
   allocated, separately cached) vs a fused SoA block's one. Quantification rows (batch-2,
   slot-map + arena grants): handle-validation ns/access · insert/remove (occupancy
   writes) · iterate-occupied · arena `grow(to:)` relocation vs capacity. **QUANTIFIED at
   batch-2 (06-12)**: validation 0.81 ns flat (substrate) / 1.21 ns (wrapper) vs 0.30 ns raw
   array — the two-stdlib-Array ledger costs ≈ 0.9 ns/access all-in; hole-skip iterate
   +0.53 ns/visited slot at 50% occupancy; grow(to: 2n) relocation 11.4–12.5 ns/slot,
   linear 256→64k. The arc-5 SoA re-cut's win is bounded by these sub-ns/access and
   ~12 ns/slot-relocate terms.
2. **Tree.Position re-cut.** The ~16 B/slot position side-table is already explicit in the
   read-only seed: trees' `Performance Tests.swift:413–422` accounts bytes/slot = node
   stride + 9 B column ledger (8 generation + 1 occupancy) + 16 B
   `Store.Generational.Handle?` side table. The BYTE cost is settled by the seed; the
   ACCESS cost rides the same batch-2 slot-map/arena rows. Trees stay out of this arc's
   edit scope.
3. **Sequencing input from W2**: B-7 (the Θ(capacity) `Hash.Indexed` remove + its
   back>front inversion) dominates any SoA-layout effect by 3–4 orders of magnitude in the
   ordered families. If arc-5 budgets one structural change first, B-7 is it; the SoA
   re-cut's win is bounded by ns-scale per-access effects.

## Residual at W3 (grant-blocked rows; the only outstanding inventory items)

| Family | Inventory measures pending | Blocking grant |
|---|---|---|
**NONE — the inventory is COMPLETE.** All ten family surfaces measured: array (W1) ·
queue, deque, set-ordered, dictionary-ordered (W2 batch-1) · slot-map, arena
(Storage.Generational), hash-table engine (batch-2) · shared (gate decomposition), stack,
set, dictionary (terminal wave). Hash-table ownership has passed to the engine-fix
executor; this document's engine rows stand as the before-picture.
